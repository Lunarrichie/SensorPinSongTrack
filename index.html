      <h4>Lyrics:</h4>
      <p class="lyrics">
        You’ll go far might go to north star <br />
        Losing you left me blue like an avatar<br />
        day u left, knew I’d put u in my memoir<br />
        But Abercrombie just kept forcing us apart<br />
        Became my friend then I heard the door chime<br />
        Said sorry I’m your manager I’m not your ride or die<br />
        Put my emotions on a rollercoaster ride <br />
        But please don’t leave again, can’t live through another goodbye?<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="chorus">
        Miah without you I don’t even know what to do<br />
        I can’t tell the difference between what is fake and true<br />
        Sometimes you’re sassy but you are never rude <br />
        You are like the sensor pin that got stuck to my shoe<br />
        Like cacti embedded on a leather cowboy boot<br />
        From summer to january changing like the moon<br />
        Cause no matter where you can go <br />
        It’s always gonna be true<br />
        That 20164 is always needing you <br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="richard">
        It was life or death wondering if we shouldn’t clock in<br />
        Another minute without you I think we would’ve lost it<br />
        Spent my allowance thought It would’ve gone towards college<br />
        But what’s the point if you’re not even there when we accomplish <br />
        Plan wasn’t made for days we weren’t selling it<br />
        Clearance racks full extra 30 couldn't convince<br />
        We needed the skill in your clientele assistance<br />
        If you weren’t back, think we would have gone out of business <br />
        Amaryllis Bestie thought she could take your place<br />
        But the grief was too strong no one could ever replace<br />
        She’s smart and she’s helpful works at fast pace<br />
        But none of it could work had it not been for your name<br />
        Shifts got added then dropped on the same day <br />
        It was happening to everyone and spreading like a plaque <br />
        no one could compare to ur awesome fashion taste<br />
        No customer was styled, loyalty was last place<br />
